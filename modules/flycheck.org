#+TITLE: flycheck: Get the computer proof reading
#+AUTHOR: Aqeel Akber

* flycheck
=flycheck= is a modern drop in replacement for emacs =flymake=. It's
faster, more memory efficient, supports more languages, and has a
great project culture.

I say that this is doing proof reading because you can use linters to
provide style warnings, as well as whether your code will compile or
not.

* C/C++ checking with =flycheck-irony=

Git: https://github.com/Sarcasm/flycheck-irony

The =flycheck-irony= checker is faster than the inbuilt =clang= or
=gcc= checkers with flycheck for the same reasons as described in [[file:company.org::*C/C%2B%2B%20completion%20with%20%3Dcompany-irony%3D][
C/C++ completion with =company-irony=]].
