#+TITLE: irony: C/C++ minor mode providing clang niceties
#+AUTHOR: Aqeel Akber

* irony

=irony= exposes =libclang= using a client / server interface. The
server binary written in C++, =irony-server=, runs in the background
and doesn't lock up emacs when it's working. 

It has plenty of nice things built ontop of it.

Git: https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
  (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
  (add-hook 'objc-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Compile database

=irony= requires a compile database for your project to work. The
executable =irony-cdb= tries to do this automagically. It's
recommended to hook this process to =irony-mode=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'irony-cdb-autosetup-compile-options)
#+END_SRC

For clarity, if you wanted to make one of these databases manually
using =cmake= you could execute the following command in your projects
directory in shell.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cmake . -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1
#+END_SRC
